title:   Hello js13k world, once again!
summary: We're launching our blog - now also across Medium and other platforms.
---

Ok, first of all sorry for messing up with you. I launched the js13kBlog two weeks ago as a Hexo instance on my own 
server, and now I’m restarting everything on Medium. The [js13kGames](//js13kgames.com) competition is evolving 
over the years, I’m doing lots of stuff on my own, so I can make mistakes or change my mind, but everything I do is 
hopefully for the better.

So, having this out of the way, welcome to the **brand new js13kBlog**, but this time **on Medium**. That Hexo build 
was cool and all, but it’s all about interactions, so I decided to go where the people are. And you seem to be on Medium. 
I’m not sure if this will work, but at least I’ll try and see what happens.

Your feedback is super valuable - after all the competition was created for YOU, so be sure to let me know your thoughts, 
ideas, suggestions on improvements etc., thanks!

About the competition itself: I wanted to have a lot of things announced days, if not weeks ago already, but, you know, 
"stuff happened" and most of it got delayed because "various reasons". I’m going to catch up on all that and publish 
a few hot posts between now and the start of the competition, on August 13th.

Keep your eyes out on this place!
